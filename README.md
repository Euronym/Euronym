### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Bruno. I'm an undergraduate student at Federal University of ParÃ¡ and a member of the Research Group on Computer Networks and Multimedia 
Communications where i work with machine learning applications for e-Health security and smart grids. My main interest is research but i also enjoy writing different types of systems that run both natively and on the web.
